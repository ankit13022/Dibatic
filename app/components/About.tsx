          About This Project
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          This project is designed with a single purpose in mind: to empower
          individuals to take proactive steps in understanding their health.
          With a focus on two significant health concerns — diabetes and kidney
          disease — this web-based tool provides a simple and accessible way to
          assess potential risks based on a few key health indicators.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Health awareness is one of the most important parts of disease
          prevention. Unfortunately, many people live with conditions like
          diabetes or kidney issues without knowing it, simply because they
          don’t have easy access to tools or the knowledge to understand early
          signs. That’s where this platform comes in. It offers a user-friendly
          experience where anyone can enter a few basic health details and
          receive a preliminary risk assessment — instantly and privately.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          The idea behind this project is not to diagnose or replace medical
          professionals. Rather, it serves as a supportive guide, helping users
          identify whether they might be at risk and should consider speaking
          with a healthcare provider. Sometimes, a simple tool like this can be
          the nudge someone needs to take their health seriously or catch a
          potential issue early.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          We understand that health can be a sensitive topic, and that not
          everyone is comfortable navigating complex medical forms or reading
          through long articles. That’s why the design of this platform is
          clean, straightforward, and approachable. Whether you're a young adult
          trying to stay ahead of your health or someone older who just wants
          peace of mind, the process is quick, private, and easy to understand.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Ultimately, this project is a reflection of a growing movement: using
          technology not just for convenience, but for care. It represents a
          step toward a future where people can better understand their own
          bodies and make informed decisions, right from their phones or
          computers. Whether you're here out of curiosity or concern, this tool
          is made for you — with the goal of helping you feel more informed,
          more prepared, and more in control of your health journey.
